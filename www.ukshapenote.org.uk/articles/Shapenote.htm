					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					Shapenote music, or Sacred Harp music as it is more often known, 
					has its origins firmly rooted in the English psalmody 
					tradition.&nbsp; Psalm singing was a popular part of worship in 
					England over 450 years ago, <span lang="en-gb">and </span>
					most people today know the tune set to Psalm 100,</span> -
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style">All 
					People That On Earth Do Dwell. This tune came from the 
					Anglo-Genevan Psalter published in 1556, set to the Biblical 
					Psalms of David that had been turned into verse form by 
					Sternhold &amp; Hopkins less than a decade earlier.</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					This tune, and 12 others like it were taken across to New 
					England by the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620, and just as in 
					England, so in the next 150 years, new tunes were written to 
					fit both the Sternhold &amp; Hopkins psalms (the Old Version), 
					the Tate &amp; Brady psalms (published in 1696 and known as the 
					New Version), and most importantly, the poetry of the 
					greatest hymn writer of the English speaking world, Isaac 
					Watts. Most people know hymns and psalms set to words by 
					Watts; still sung today are: O God our Help in Ages Past 
					(Psalm 90), Jesus Shall Reign Where �er the Sun (Psalm 72) 
					and When I Survey the Wondrous Cross.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					The native born composers of the New World were influenced 
					by the psalm tunes being written in the mother country 
					during the 18<sup>th</sup> century, and the first American 
					to publish a collection of his own compositions was William 
					Billings, in 1770.&nbsp; Billings was born in 1746, in Boston, 
					and through his publications and touring &nbsp;Massachusetts, 
					running singing schools to teach the colonial communities 
					these new tunes, he inspired others to do the same.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					Over 300 collections of original American sacred music, were 
					published before 1810, but it was a book called <i>The Easy 
					Instructor</i>, compiled and produced by William Smith and 
					William Little in Philadelphia, &nbsp;that introduced a special 
					form of notation, one with different shaped note heads.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					Nearly 800 years earlier, a system of naming notes with 
					syllables was devised by Guido D 'Arrezo in Italy.&nbsp; He was 
					working on a slightly simpler form of music, based on 6 
					notes, not the 8 we have today. He named these notes UT, RE, 
					MI, FA, SO and LA.&nbsp; English composers as early as John 
					Playford in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century used D 'Arezzo's 
					syllables as an aid to teaching psalm music, but by then the 
					syllables UT and RE had fallen into disuse.&nbsp; FA, SOL, LA 
					were repeated up the 8 note major scale, MI became the 7<sup>th</sup> 
					note and the scale began again on FA. The minor scale 
					started LA, MI, FA, SOL, LA, FA, with SOL as the 7<sup>th</sup> 
					note and ended on LA. It became as known as Lancashire 
					solfege. </font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					This teaching aid went over to New England in the early 18th 
					century and was printed as part of the tuition instructions 
					at the front of most psalm tune books.&nbsp; In 1786, a man 
					called John Connelly, living in Philadelphia, devised 
					specially shaped note heads to correspond with the solfege 
					names, with FA having a triangular notehead, SOL a circle, 
					LA a square, and MI a diamond.&nbsp; He sold the idea to 
					Smith and Little, who used it for the first time in <i>The Easy 
					Instructor</i>, which they brought out in 1800.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">By 
					the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, tastes in 
					church music, both in the old country, and in New England, 
					were changing.&nbsp; The old tunes were thought of as simple and 
					rustic, and in New England were ousted by music of the likes 
					of Handel, Haydn and Mozart, although still set to religious 
					texts.&nbsp; In Old England, largely for reasons of doctrine, 
					rather than fashion, the old psalm tunes were superseded by 
					new ones which were to appear in print in </font><i>
					<font size="4">Hymns Ancient and Modern.</font></i></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">In 
					America, some of the old psalm tunes managed to survive, by 
					migrating down the Appalachians in collections of music 
					which introduced new works by composers from the Southern 
					States, set to Evangelical texts in preference to Isaac 
					Watts.&nbsp; The last of the collections, the Sacred Harp, 
					first published in 1844 and the only book of its kind to 
					remain in continuous publication today, uses the same shaped 
					notation first seen in <i>The Easy Instructor</i>.&nbsp; It is a living 
					tradition in many communities in the Southern United States, 
					&nbsp;Alan Lomax's field recordings of Sacred Harp singing in the 
					1940s bear an uncanny resemblance to the singing at 
					gatherings (conventions) in Alabama and Georgia today.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					The 1991 edition of The Sacred Harp contains a wide range of 
					sacred tunes from The Old Hundredth to works by living 
					composers, who write in the same genre as their forefathers 
					of 150 years previously, and to the cherished Isaac Watts�s 
					texts of old.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
					Thanks to the perpetuation of this musical tradition in the 
                    Southern States, nearly 40 years ago, singers from New England rediscovered 
					this link to their musical heritage, and re-introduced in 
					Boston the practice of psalm singing that had been lost in 
					the North Eastern United states for 150 years.
					Several American singers have brought this vibrant and 
                    exciting music back to the UK since 1990. A debt of 
                    gratitude from singers in the UK is owed in particular to 
                    Larry Gordon from Vermont, in the forefront of the New 
                    England revival. Larry hosted a group of singers from the UK 
                    in autumn 1995, enabling them for the first time to attend a 
                    Sacred Harp Convention in the USA, in Burlington, Vermont .</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">In 
					1996 the first UK Convention was held, in 
					Hitchin, Herts., organised by some of the party who had 
                    visited Vermont in the previous year. The guest leader on 
                    that occasion was Bruce Randall, from Massachusetts, and for 
                    several&nbsp; years thereafter, singers at the Convention 
                    were able to share in the wisdom and experience of Robin 
                    Fox, Steve Marini, Richard DeLong, David Lee, Ginnie Ely, 
                    and Shelbie Sheppard.&nbsp; With Shelbie in 2003, came the 
                    famous 'Southern Bus', a coachload of Southern singers who 
                    brought a new dimension to the understanding of the music 
                    and its traditions. Similarly, within a couple of years of 
                    the start of the UK Conventions,&nbsp; singers began to 
                    attend the National Sacred Harp Convention in Alabama, and 
                    have been privileged to share in the wealth of one of the 
                    oldest extant forms of music history and practice in the 
                    USA.&nbsp; British attendance at the Fasola Summer Camps, 
                    organised by the Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Foundation, 
                    has increased experience and enhanced interest and singing 
                    practice.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Goudy Old Style"><font size="4">
                    What is the attraction of this form of sacred music for us 
                    in the UK?&nbsp; Possibly that the original roots are 
                    English, that it is enjoyed within a community of fellowship 
                    that has bounds which extend in both directions across the 
                    Atlantic Ocean, and that much of the music was written by 
                    and for the ordinary working man.&nbsp; All-embracing, the 
                    texts and the music call to the spirituality within us, 
                    whether we are believers or not.&nbsp; Some call it sacred 
                    folk music, certainly&nbsp; choral music it isn't, but to be 
                    sung 'lustily and with good courage', as John Wesley 
                    prescribed over 250 years ago.<br>
