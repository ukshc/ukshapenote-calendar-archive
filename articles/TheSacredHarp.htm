      <b>Development of Shape-Note Singing </b> </P></A>
      <P class=text><I>The Sacred Harp</I> uses notation developed by the 
      progressive New England singing masters William Little and William Smith, 
      who published the <I>Easy Instructor</I> in 1801. Their shape-note system 
      was designed to teach sight-reading and enable users to sing complex, 
      sophisticated music. </P>
      <P class=text>The practice of singing the scale in syllables&#8212;"Do, re, mi, 
      fa, sol, la, ti"&#8212;originated in Europe long before 1800. Sometimes not 
      seven but four syllables were used: fa, sol, la, and mi. 
      <TABLE class=imagetableright width=106 align=right border=0 id="table16">
        <TBODY>

          <TD class=thumbnailCaptions><i><b><font size="2">The shaped tune 
			&quot;Wondrous Love&quot;</font></b></i></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The 
      major scale is expressed as fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa. Smith and 
      Little gave each of the four syllables a shape: a triangle (fa), a circle 
      (sol), a rectangle (la), and a diamond (mi). The musical phrase (right) 
      from the hymn "Wondrous Love" shows these shapes in use. </P>
      <P class=text>Singing masters taught sight-reading by having students 
      first "sing the shapes." The line above, for example, would be sung as "La 
      la sol mi sol la sol mi la la sol." This practice survives in Sacred Harp 
      singing today. Singers first sing the shapes, or syllables for the notes 
      of their parts, and then the words. </P><A name=header2>
      <P class=subhead1><b>History</b></P></A>
      <P class=text>Shape-note tune books and the singing masters who produced 
      them, as well as the social and cultural forces that affected shape-note 
      singing, have been widely studied. Scholars have written extensively about 
      <I>The Sacred Harp</I> itself, its editions, and its survival as the most 
      resilient of the four-shape books. Neither the Civil War nor the 
      introduction of seven-shape books and round-note denominational hymnals 
      extinguished singers' enthusiasm for <I>The Sacred Harp</I>. Nor did the 
      coming of radio and records or such newer styles of sacred music as 
      gospel. </P>
      <P class=text>Singers today are likely to use one of two revisions. <I>The 
      B. F. White Sacred Harp</I>, known as "the Cooper book," descends from a 
      1902 revision by W. M. Cooper of Dothan, Alabama.

          <TD class=thumbnailCaptions><i><b><font size="2">Singing from the 
			Sacred Harp</font></b></i></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>It is 
      widely used in south Georgia, north Florida, and the Gulf region extending 
      to Texas. It has a strong following among white singers but is also 
      favored by African American singers in that area. (<I>The Colored Sacred 
      Harp</I>, by Judge Jackson of Alabama, a Cooper book singer, was published 
      in 1934. It contains shape-note songs composed or arranged by Jackson and 
      other African American singers. This collection has been popularized by 
      Alabama's Wiregrass Singers.) The other revision, arising from White's 
      circle of friends, children, and pupils, came to be called "the Denson 
      book." It began with a 1911 revision chaired by J. S. James of 
      Douglasville, Georgia. This edition, in turn, was the basis for revisions 
      by members of the Denson family of Alabama. Thomas J. Denson established 
      the Sacred Harp Publishing Company, which published <I>The Original Sacred 
      Harp (Denson Revision)</I> in 1936. The 1991 edition of <I>The Sacred 
      Harp</I> was produced with an editorial committee headed by Hugh McGraw of 
      Bremen, Georgia, where the Sacred Harp Publishing Company is now located. 
      This 1991 book is the choice among singers in northern Georgia and 
      Alabama; moreover, it is the edition most widely used nationally and 
      internationally. </P>
      <P class=text>Today's popularity of Sacred Harp singing owes much to B. F. 
      White and the subsequent singers who collected and arranged tunes, taught 
      singing schools, and wrote about and faithfully supported shape-note 
      singing. Especially deserving mention is Hugh McGraw, who has worked 
      tirelessly to promote learning and to reach new singers. McGraw was named 
      a National Heritage Fellow in 1982 for his efforts on behalf of Sacred 
      Harp singing. Another singing master is Richard DeLong of Carrollton, who 
      served with McGraw and others on the 1991 revision committee. Among 
      Georgia singers who use the Cooper revision, David Lee of Hoboken has 
      traveled and taught. The efforts of these singers and many others have 
      spread Sacred Harp singing, and today singers gather in Chicago, Boston, 
      and Albuquerque, as well as in Tallapoosa, Atlanta, and Birmingham. </P><A

      <P class=text>Sacred Harp singings follow a characteristic pattern

		<p>The 
      singers sit in a hollow square with four sections&#8212;tenor, bass, treble, and 
      alto. Tenors face altos, and trebles face basses. In a manner reminiscent 
      of the singing schools, a leader chooses songs that are called a "lesson" 
      and the singers are the "class." Leaders take turns standing in the center 
      of the square, beating time in a traditional method appropriate to the 
      song's time signature. Singing continues all day, with a noontime break 
      for dinner on the grounds. These singings require stamina and musical 
      athleticism, since the group may sing as many as ninety songs in the 
      course of one day. </p>
		</P>
      <P class=text>The sound of Sacred Harp may vary a bit from region to 
      region, and white singers have different styles from African American 
      singers. But regardless of location or voices, Sacred Harp sounds unlike 
      academic choral singing or gospel singing in which melody dominates and 
      harmony embellishes and supports it. The tunes of <I>The Sacred Harp</I> 
      do have a melody part, the tenor, but it coexists with three other parts 
      in no way merely supportive of a dominant melody. The parts in shape-note 
      singing are so distinct that traditional tune books like <I>The Sacred 
      Harp</I> print them on separate staves, displaying what is called 
      dispersed harmony. </P>
      <P class=text>Gapped scales (having less than the usual seven notes) and 
      unusual harmonies help account for this traditional music's characteristic 
      sound. Also unique is the doubling of two parts, both men and women 
      singing tenor and treble. Untrained voices prevail, so the singing sounds 
      loud and exhilarating. Although singers in different communities may 
      prefer slower or faster times, leaders set the tempo. One occasionally 
      hears singers warn each other, "Watch the leader," when the class goes too 
      slowly or runs over a fermata (pause sign). </P><A name=header4>

      <P class=text>In the 1844 <I>Sacred Harp</I> and its various revisions

      Stennett, and John Newton. Some of these texts, as modified by 
      nineteenth-century American singers, have acquired choruses in the 
      camp-meeting spiritual style. In addition to the hymns, the tune book also 
      includes anthems&#8212;passages of prose, usually scripture&#8212;and other texts 
      including odes and "set pieces," words written for a particular tune or 
      setting. <br>
&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=text>Some hymn tunes, both English and American, were originally 
      associated with work songs, sea songs, drinking songs, or similar tunes of 
      secular folk origin. Some, like the familiar "Old Hundred," came from the 
      psalm-singing tradition. Others are "fuging tunes," complicated settings 
      in a style originating in the English Renaissance and based on metrical 
      psalm-tunes. The <I>fuge</I>, like the <I>fugue</I> of Bach and other 
      eighteenth-century composers, takes its name from a word that means "to 
      fly" or "to flee," but a fuging tune is not the same thing as a fugue. A 
      shape-note fuging tune has one or more sections with staggered entrances; 
      the various parts begin the fuge in different measures, rest, enter again, 
      and sing over each other, indeed making the music soar. </P>
      <P class=text>Composers of fuging tunes and other settings include New 
      Englanders William Billings, Timothy Swan, and Daniel Read and a number of 
      Georgians as well: White and his coeditor, the young E. J. King; John P. 
      Reese and his brother H. S. Reese, born in Jasper County; and Elder Edmund 
      Dumas of Forsyth. (Contributors did not always compose the tunes 
      associated with them. In <I>The Sacred Harp</I> a tune may be ascribed to 
      a composer, an arranger who learned it from older singers, or merely to an 
      earlier tune book.) Some tunes, either from their origin or because of 
      shaping through generations of traditional singers, may properly be called 
      folk tunes. </P>
      <P class=text>Sacred Harp singing preserves traditional ways from earlier 
      times but is also a living art form in which composers write new songs. 
      <I>The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition</I>, for instance, contains notable new 
      compositions along with texts and tunes from previous centuries. </P>
      <P class=text>Since 1844 Sacred Harp singers have defined, nurtured, and 
      passed along their art and their beliefs. Participants agree on two 
      points. First, this singing is democratic and independent. Free of 
      denominational ties, it represents a religious expression outside the 
      limits of any church's doctrine and discipline. Second, it is for singers, 
      not listeners. Those who sing enter into a community where sophisticated 
      musical skills, veneration for singers of previous generations, and 
      constant immersion in the poetry of the songs make for a powerful 
      experience. </P>
