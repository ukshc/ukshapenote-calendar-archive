      <strong>Make a joyful noise:<br>
		The revival of sacred harp singing</strong><br>
		<br>
		The film <em>Awake My Soul</em> begins on a narrow, rutted country road, 
		the camera viewpoint winding its way through stands of trees as the 
		sound of singing becomes louder and louder. Finally, a small wooden 
		building emerges from around a bend. It is Shoals Creek Church, located 
		deep in the Talledega National Forest in rural Georgia. And yet, despite 
		its inaccessibility, the clearing is full of cars. The church is full of 
		people, all singing at the top of their lungs, executing complicated 
		melodies and countermelodies, unaccompanied by any sort of instrument.
		<br>
		<br>
		In a way, this opening encapsulates the central paradox of sacred harp 
		singing, an art form that is nearly as old as America. Sacred harp 
		singers form a thriving community in the most isolated of places. They 
		practice a wholly participatory art, one that is seldom recorded and 
		never performed for audiences. They sing out of books of songs that may 
		be hundreds of years old, yet which continually incorporate new music 
		composed in the sacred harp style. <br>
		<br>
		What exactly is sacred harp singing? In its simplest terms, it is a 
		four-part, unaccompanied vocal art form that originated in Colonial 
		America. Its hymns are written out in a four-figured notation, using a 
		different shape for each of its notes, fa, sol, la and mi. (It is 
		sometimes called shape note singing because of the notation.) <br>
		<br>
		Sacred Harp singing is a participatory art, rather than a performance. 
		Singers gather for all day sings, starting at nine or ten in the 
		morning, breaking for lunch and returning to sing late into the 
		afternoon. In a one day gathering, singers may work through 90 to 100 
		songs, the first time through singing only the notes ('fa', 'sol', 'la' 
		and 'mi'), 
		the second time using the words. Four groups of singers - soprano, alto, 
		tenor and bass - are arranged facing inward, towards the 'hollow 
		square' so created, the best place to experience sacred harp singing. Singers take 
		turns as leader, beating out the time in this hollow square, <br>
		<br>
		<em><strong>Music for Singers</strong></em><br>
		Still unlike many traditional art forms, sacred harp singing has never 
		really been commercialized and so remains remarkably uncorrupted by the 
		modern world. Matt Hinton, who with his wife created <em>Awake My Soul,</em> 
		speculates that sacred harp music may have survived intact at least 
		partly because of its communal, participatory nature. 'It is not music 
		just for listening to. It is music primarily for singing,' says Hinton. <br>
		<br>
		'I do not just mean that there is a priority placed on participating, 
		which there is, but what I mean is just the very way that songs are 
		written, it is just not that suitable for listening to,' he adds. 
		'Though some people enjoy listening to it and I certainly do.'<br>
		<br>
		Hinton goes on to explain that when the uninitiated first hear sacred 
		harp music, typically from the back of a church, what they perceive is a 
		mishmash of four distinctly different parts. 'If they had to hum a tune, 
		the melody would probably be the first couple of notes of the tenor line 
		and then a couple of notes of the treble line and a couple of notes of 
		the alto line and put them all together,' Hinton says. And that assumes new listeners can even pick a central melodic line out of 
		a complex tapestry of counterpoints. 'Sometimes there really is no main 
		melody. That is, there is not a melody [line] that other parts are 
		supporting, but rather each part is generally written as something 
		interesting and important all by itself. ... ... ... That’s why bass 
		singers, in particular, and tenors for that matter, really love singing 
		it. Ordinarily they get stuck with these really boring parts in 
		choruses. Which purely serve to be a foundation upon which the sopranos 
		get to sing the melody.'<br>
		<br>
		That complexity, in itself, has helped protect the art form. “There’s 
		not anybody who could walk into a Sacred Harp singing, not really 
		knowing anything about it, and take it over,” says Hinton. “Even if 
		you’re a professional musician and know how to read music and so on, you 
		still have to learn how to do it. At which point you begin to learn some 
		of its priorities and to understand it.” <br>
		<br>
		'On the one hand, it is very open and embracing. Everybody is welcome to 
		come, and welcome indeed, to come up and lead a song,' he says. 'But on 
		the other hand, if you come in, if you walk into the room, a lot of 
		people [will have their] backs turned to you. We’re all facing the center and it 
		is sort of a closed off thing. That sort of gives off a feeling of 
		being…being a community on one hand, but also having its back turned on 
		the outside world.'<br>
		<br>
		<em><strong>Help me to sing</strong></em><br>
		Sacred harp singing is a tradition that has been handed down, generation 
		after generation in the south. Many of today’s singers come from 
		families that have sung these songs for as long as anyone can remember. 
		Elderly singers talk of playing outside while their parents sang, or 
		hearing these songs from their own grandparents. Yet it is a tradition 
		that is always in danger of dying out if new singers are not brought in. 
		So, while deeply rooted in personal and community history, while 
		physically and metaphorically inward-looking, the sacred harp art form 
		is also remarkably inclusive. <br>
		<br>
		'At many of these sings, there’s a memorial afterwards where we 
		commemorate singers who we’ve sung with and who have died in the 
		previous year,' says Hinton. 'Every so often, someone will get up and 
		say, well, I’d like to sing this for Uncle so and so, who I used to hear 
		in the 1940s and 1950s sing. So some of the elderly people who sing this 
		kind of music, they’re not going to be with us forever. And so they have 
		to be replaced by somebody. So there’s always a real strong motivation 
		to get more people there.'<br>
		<br>
		The documentary, <em>Awake My Soul</em>, traces the history of sacred 
		harp singing from its beginnings in New England during the Great 
		Awakening through its heyday in the 19th century through its current 
		revival. Yet alongside this history, the film captures the art form in 
		its current, living state, with extensive footage of sacred harp 
		singing, interviews with leading singers and songwriters. <br>
		<br>
		Matt Hinton, who made the documentary with his wife Erica, says that he 
		stumbled across Sacred Harp singing as a teenager. He was at a concert 
		featuring North Carolina ballad singer Betty Smith when someone handed 
		him a flyer for an upcoming sacred harp singing. 'I went out to the 
		singing and it was in this old brick church, maybe 35 or 40 minutes 
		outside of Atlanta, and couldn’t really believe what it was I was 
		hearing. It was a relatively small group of people there -- maybe 40 or 
		so people -- but it sounded like there were hundreds. You could hear 
		them before you got to the door of the place,' he remembers. 'At the 
		time I thought that these were the last people in the world who were 
		doing this. I thought it was a lost musical tribe.'<br>
		<br>
		From that point on, Hinton went to two or three sings a year, always 
		sitting in the back and reluctant to participate. Erica, who would later 
		become his wife, came with him on one of these expeditions; she later 
		learned that her grandmother had been a sacred harp singer. Both were 
		students at Georgia State University when they met. Erica took a 
		documentary film class and decided to make her assigned 10-minute film 
		on sacred harp singing. <br>
		<br>
		'So we went to a couple of singings one weekend and she edited that and 
		made a ten-minute film, which she called ‘Awake My Soul,' ' he said. ' 
		But ten minutes is just not enough, obviously, to cover the entire 
		history of the Sacred Harp singing. We kept bringing the camera and sort 
		of never considered that project to be finished.'<br>
		<br>
		<em><strong>Contemporary interpretations<br>
		</strong></em>That ten-minute 
		film has since evolved into a full-length documentary, plus a two CD 
		set, with one CD (<em>Awake My Soul</em>) comprised of traditional 
		sacred harp singing, the other (<em>Help Me to Sing</em>) of covers of 
		sacred harp hymns interpreted by contemporary artists. <br>
		<br>
		One of the biggest names on this second disc is John Paul Jones, the 
		former Led Zeppelin bass player who has long had a fascination for 
		traditional American music. Hinton, a self-described Zeppelin fanatic, 
		says that he ran into Jones at Merle Fest in North Carolina (where <em>
		Awake My Soul</em> was screening) and asked for an autograph. 'Any kind 
		of notion of coolness that you have?' he says. 'completely goes out the 
		window when you’re with John Paul Jones.'<br>
		<br>
		As it happened, the only paper he had to offer was a copy of the sacred 
		harp songbook. The two had a brief conversation and Hinton gave Jones a 
		copy of his album, at that time, comprised only of authentic, choral 
		versions of sacred harp songs. (The covers came later.) The next day, 
		Hinton ran into Jones again and the two had a long conversation about 
		sacred harp singing. ' I was in the surreal position of actually being 
		able to tell John Paul Jones anything about music, you know what I 
		mean?' recalls Hinton. 'Which was strange because I had learned how to 
		play guitar based on listening to his recordings.'<br>
		<br>
		Jones had recently produced an album by the string band Uncle Earl, and 
		Hinton had already been in contact with the band’s fiddler, Raina 
		Gellert , about contributing a sacred harp recording. “So we were 
		emailing back and forth, and I said, by the way, Raina Gellert and John 
		Paul Jones sure has a nice ring to it,” Hinton recalls. The two of them 
		ended up recording <i>'Blooming Youth,'</i> their two voices intertwining in 
		one of the starkest, most haunting cuts on the album. <br>
		<br>
		Other singers came to the project through deep personal connections with 
		sacred harp music. Sam Amidon, who sings 'Kedron' on the covers disc, 
		says he was first introduced to sacred harp singing by his mom and dad. 
		'My parents got deeply involved with shape-note singing when, in the 
		midst of the folk revival, they joined the <i>Word of Mouth 
		Chorus, </i>led by Larry Gordon in the '70s, before they were married - they were in their 
		mid-20s,' he says. 'They toured with Larry &amp; <i>Bread &amp; Puppet</i> 
		before settling in Brattleboro, Vermont. From the time I was born there 
		were monthly sings in our town and often in our house, so this is some 
		of the first music I ever heard or participated in.'<br>
		<br>
		Stephen Nichols of the <i>Good Players</i>, who covers 'David’ s Lamentations' 
		also had an early introduction to the sacred harp tradition. 'My father 
		is a Southern Baptist music minister. I remember academic discussions 
		about shape note/Sacred Harp music,' he explains. 'The church pianist 
		led a workshop on shape note singing when I was too young to appreciate 
		it.'<br>
		<br>
		Nichols says that, like many people, he didn’t fully appreciate the 
		music until he attended a sing. 'The curious methodology of shaped notes 
		is irrelevant when you're surrounded by over 100 people singing with 
		conviction at the top of their lungs in the middle of nowhere,' he says.
		<br>
		<br>
		Moreover, the artists on the disc maintain that sacred harp singing is 
		not a historical oddity, but rather a living, breathing influence on 
		their own work. Amidon says that sacred harp harmonies and counterpoints 
		have been a large part of his personal musical DNA -- and that they 
		continue to influence his recorded output. 'The style of singing has 
		been hugely influential for me, it was the main kind of singing I did in 
		high school; the open harmonies of the songs are really powerful &amp; 
		always inspiring,' he explains. 'I sing a lot of re-worked shape-note 
		pieces on my solo records.'<br>
		<br>
		<em><strong>The power of incorrectness</strong></em><br>
		The covers are very fine, yet you cannot help returning to the disc of 
		originals, recorded in churches with amateur singers, in a style that 
		is fierce and forceful and utterly transporting. Even well-known 
		melodies like 'New Britain' (also known as 'Amazing Grace') take on 
		unfamiliar heft and complexity in these arrangements, as well as a 
		volume that is nearly shocking. <br>
		<br>
		Asked if he has a favorite among the traditional songs, Hinton first 
		demurs, then points to 'Eternal Day.'&nbsp; 'If somebody asked me to play them 
		one Sacred Harp song which would completely illustrate what Sacred Harp 
		singing is about, that has all the elements that are distinctive about 
		Sacred Harp singing, that’s the song that I would choose,' he says. The 
		song was written in the 1800s by a traveling pastor named J.P. Reese, 
		and incorporates all the “incorrectness” of traditional sacred harp music, 
		the two-note chords and parallel fifths. It is a fuguing tune, with the 
		four sections singing the same motif at staggered intervals, for a 
		dazzling sense of motion and pursuit. And it is sung imperfectly, by 
		ordinary people, pushing their voices to their very limits. You can hear 
		a baby crying in the background. Yet for all this wrong-ness, there is 
		no denying the power of the song. 'It’s crazy what a heavy song that 
		is,' he adds. 'I’d put that up against any Black Sabbath song in the 
		world in terms of sheer heaviness.'<br>
		<br>
		Amidon also sees parallels between sacred harp and rock music. 'I have 
		always heard a lot of the intensity of shape note music in the singing 
		of Kurt Cobain, and [also in] his guitar playing too,' he says. ' I think that's what the 
		great Tim Eriksen was picking up on in his work with the band <i>Cordelia's 
		Dad</i> in the nineties, when they sang shape note songs - I think they even 
		opened for Nirvana at one point. I also feel like there is an 
		interesting connection between the harmonies and textures of sacred harp 
		singing, and the drone minimalism of the seventies of LaMonte Young and 
		Tony Conrad.' <br>
		<br>
		Hinton says that he and Tim Eriksen have talked at length about the 
		parallels between punk rock and sacred harp. 'Who knows what the 
		relationship is?” he says, “but when you think about it, parallel fifths 
		and two-note chords, that’s just power chords on the guitar. They sound 
		really freaky when you’ve got people singing power chords, rather than a 
		guitar.&nbsp; And counterintuitive as it may seem, it’s possible to draw a 
		direct line of succession between sacred harp singing and rock and roll.'&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Hinton starts with the <i>Louvin Brothers,</i> natives of sacred harp 
		stronghold Henniker, Alabama. The <i>Louvin Brothers</i> inspired the <i>Everly 
		Brothers</i>, particularly influencing their use of harmonies. And the
		<i>Everly Brothers</i> inspired the <i>Beatles</i>. “' It may not be too much of a 
		stretch to say that if there was no Sacred Harp there would be no 
		<i>Beatles</i>,' says Hinton. <br>
		<br>
		<em><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong></em><br>
		Rock borrows heavily from African-American traditions, too -- like blues, 
		jazz and gospel. All of which brings up an interesting question: is 
		Sacred Harp singing an all-white tradition? Hinton says no. <br>
		<br>
		' Black people certainly sang Sacred Harp plenty much, ' he explains. 'In 
		fact, we sing with a guy here now in Atlanta whose great grandfather, or 
		maybe even grandfather, was a slave. He wound up [in] a chapel after he 
		was freed specifically designed for singing Sacred Harp. And this guy 
		remembers singing in that and being raised in it when he was a kid.'<br>
		<br>
		But when gospel music appeared in the early 20th century, black churches 
		turned to it even more than white churches, with the result that there 
		are very few black sacred harp communities now in the American south. 
		However, there are some, including the Wiregrass family in Ozark, 
		Alabama. This family descends from a sacred harp compiler named Judge 
		Jackson, who in 1935 produced a book called <em>The Colored Sacred Harp</em>. 
		One of the Wiregrass family, Dewey Williams, took an early leadership 
		role in the national sacred harp organization and members of the family 
		still participate in its conventions. Yet, as the film <em>Awake My Soul</em> 
		makes clear, there are very few black faces at southern sacred harp 
		sings…and very few young people either. <br>
		<br>
		' As the world became more modern, people became less interested in that 
		old time-y stuff. Even in the 1800s there are these newspaper articles 
		that we’ve seen that talk about this old time-y music. There’s almost 
		never been a time when Sacred Harp wasn’t old-fashioned. If it’s 
		old-time-y in the 1800s, what is it now? '<br>
		<br>
		Yet though the authentic southern singing groups chronicled in the 
		documentary may be aging rapidly, Hinton says that younger people have 
		been joining up in droves in the east and Midwest. A thriving community 
		in Northampton, Massachusetts, for instance, draws upwards of 400 people 
		to the Western Mass Sacred Harp Convention, many of them under 35. <br>
		<br>
		That’s maybe because people of all ages and backgrounds are beginning to 
		see sacred harp music as an antidote to the isolation and wall-to-wall 
		consumerism of modern life. ' Sacred Harp singing and communal singing in 
		general reminds us that we're part of a whole, ' says Nichols. ' It's an 
		intimate exchange of ideas and emotions without judgment or pretense. 
		Anyone is welcome regardless of ability or religious affiliation. In a 
		time of increasing personal insulation and lives lived in front of 
		screens, group singing is an alternative to constant consumption. You 
		participate. You make the music. '</td>
