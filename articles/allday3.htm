					<font face="Georgia"><b><i>The Sacred Harp</i></b> is a 19th 
					century shape-note songbook which contains many of America's 
					earliest songs. Published in Hamilton, Georgia in 1844, <i>The Sacred Harp</i> was one of 
					the last of the old fashioned &quot;four shaped&quot; oblong songbooks 
					compiled in America. The term also refers to the type of a 
					cappella, four part, participatory singing associated with 
					this and other similar songbooks. No instruments are used. 
					Only the one given by God, the human voice: That is, the 
					&quot;sacred harp.&quot; </font></p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">One might say that <i>The Sacred Harp</i> was the crowning 
					achievement of a trajectory of American music which began 
					during the American Revolution, when itinerant, and largely 
					self-taught, singing masters began offering singing schools 
					to communities across New England. These singing school 
					teachers, such as William Billings, filled a real need in 
					early American communities. The congregational singing in 
					the churches, according to contemporary accounts, left much 
					to be desired. The congregations were, by and large, 
					musically illiterate and the number of tunes that they knew 
					by heart was small. The singing masters both taught people 
					to sing and they provided new songs which they themselves 
					composed. These songs were compiled in tune-books often 
					alongside songs written by others. Thus, a vast body of 
					music emerged in the late 1700's and into the 1800's. </font> </p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">The teaching methods employed by these early singing 
					masters seem to have been similar to those of their English 
					counterparts: students learned musical scales through the 
					use of solfege, the practice of associating each musical 
					tone with a different syllable. The early American singing 
					masters taught the version of solfege which was in current 
					use in England: Fa, Sol, La, and Mi. This differed from the 
					continental seven syllable version which is in modern use to 
					this day and which will be familiar to anyone who has seen 
					the &quot;Sound of Music:&quot; Doh, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La,  Ti, 
                    and back to Doh. Soon the American teaching methods began to 
                    distinguish themselves from all others with the advent of 
                    &quot;shaped notes.&quot; During the turn of the 19th Century, the 
                    first of many shape-note songbooks was published. </font> </p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">These new songbooks associated four 
                    distinct shapes (triangle, circle, square, and diamond) with 
                    the four syllables then in common use. The written music 
                    looked like conventional musical notation apart from the 
                    fact that the note-heads each had different shapes rather 
                    than the usual oval notes. This innovation allowed students 
                    to sing the notes of an unfamiliar tune without being 
                    burdened by concentrating on the words at the same moment. 
                    Therefore, the practice of &quot;singing the notes&quot; -in order to 
                    fix the tune in one's memory- before singing the words, 
                    began. This is a practice which has survived to the present 
                    day in the Sacred Harp tradition and is one of the real 
                    distinguishing marks of this music. </font> </p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">Over time, the &quot;homespun&quot; music associated with the 
					singing schools fell out of favour in the North-eastern 
                    region of America and it began to travel to the frontier- 
                    South and West. Many of the northern elites who were 
                    influenced by the cultural and musical norms of Europe, 
                    found this music to be unsophisticated, old fashioned, and 
                    even unscientific. Many of the musical elements which make 
                    the music so distinctive, so &quot;ancient-sounding,&quot; and yet so 
                    compelling to modern ears, were the very elements which the 
                    &quot;better music&quot; leaders, as they were called, found so 
                    objectionable. And indeed, the music clearly disregards many 
                    of the rules of musical composition which have ruled the day 
                    since the time of Bach. However, this strange music found a 
                    home in the south, in particular, and this movement south 
                    introduced new (and old) songs to the shape-note songbooks 
                    which were becoming increasingly popular in these areas. </font> </p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">The camp-meeting songs, and so-called 
                    &quot;folk hymns&quot; (which were often related to tunes which had 
                    been passed down for generations and which originated in the 
                    Old World) became an important part of the shape-note 
                    songbooks which were published in the first half of the 19th 
                    century. &quot;The Sacred Harp,&quot; like the popular &quot;Southern 
                    Harmony&quot; before it, is typical of this blend of New England 
                    hymnody with the southern-tinged and often ancient, modal 
                    melodies which were being added to these books. </font> </p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">For a variety of reasons, but 
                    especially because of the tenacity of it's compiler, B.F. 
                    White, and those who followed in his footsteps, &quot;The Sacred 
                    Harp&quot; has survived the various attempts in the past 150+ 
                    years to render it obsolete by the introduction of newer, 
                    more &quot;progressive&quot; types of hymns. However, for most of the 
                    time since it's publication, it has remained &quot;under the 
                    radar:&quot; Always in some danger of extinction, but never in 
                    any real danger of being co-opted by those who would attempt 
                    to tame it and make it more musically &quot;correct&quot; and 
                    &quot;pretty.&quot; </font> </p>
					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

					<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
					<font face="Georgia">In many ways, the story of &quot;The Sacred 
                    Harp&quot; is a story of the stubborn refusal to give up its old 
                    ways and a story of the subversion of the cultural and 
                    musical norms of the society that does not understand it. It 
                    has been sung in annual all day &quot;singings&quot; and conventions, 
                    complete with the traditional &quot;dinner on the grounds,&quot; every 
                    year since its publication, usually in old country churches. 
                    While its traditional home has been in the south, 
                    (especially Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas) there 
                    has been, for the past 30 years, a remarkable revival of 
                    interest in this old music throughout the rest of the 
                    country. More and more, people are coming under the spell of 
                    this haunting, powerful, and deeply spiritual music which is 
                    as old as America itself. </font> </p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Georgia">Sacred Harp singing is most often found in the context of &quot;all-day 
			singings,&quot; which are neither performances nor rehearsals for a 
			performances. They are just singings. At an all-day singing, which 
			traditionally last from 9:30-3:00, anyone present may stand in the 
			midst of the singers and lead any one, of the more than 500 songs in 
			&quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; hymnal, of their choosing. These leaders, are 
			constrained only by the traditional rule that a song may not be led 
			more than once in a day-long singing. Each leader will stand in the 
			centre of the &quot;hollow square,&quot; which aptly describes the space in 
			the centre of the room created by the unusual seating arrangement. 
			</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Georgia">The singers sit in sections, according to the range of their voices, 
			and each of the four sections, which correspond to the four staves 
			of music in the book, face one other section. That is, the Tenors 
			(who consist of both men and women, singing an octave apart) face 
			the Altos (usually only women), and the Basses (only men) face the 
			the Trebles (men and women, singing an octave apart). The leader 
			stands in the midst of this whirlwind of sound, which has been 
			called &quot;old fashioned surround sound&quot;, and leads the song he has 
			chosen while keeping the class on the same rhythm by &quot;beating time&quot; 
			with his hand. </font></p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Georgia">The 
            hollow square is the best place to hear this powerful music. As 
            Richard Ivey describes this experience in &quot;Awake, My Soul&quot;: 
            Sometimes, I feel that I'm just being lifted up off the ground.&quot; </font>

            All-day singings consist of two basic elements: singing and eating. 
            What sacred harp singers may lack in technical attainment in these 
            areas, they more than make up for in enthusiasm. </font>

            There has never been a singing yet recorded where a singer went home 
            hungry. The singers bring food, in oftentimes comical proportions. 
            Half &quot;regular&quot; food, half deserts. There is no membership or fees 
            associated with Sacred Harp singing and anyone is welcome to attend 
            any of the numerous singings which can now be found in any area in 
            America and in some foreign countries [including, of course, the UK! 
            - <i>Ed</i>.]. While Sacred Harp singing is clearly a part of the 
            Christian tradition, anyone is welcome to sing, regardless of her 
            faith or lack thereof. Just don't come expecting a performance.</font></td>
