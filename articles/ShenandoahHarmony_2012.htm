			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a time of 
			recession that stretches beyond national and geographical 
			boundaries, there is a lot to be said for comfort derived from the 
			past.&nbsp; For many the arrival of <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i>, in 
			content and form an<i> homage</i> to sacred and secular music over 
			more than two hundred years, will be welcomed as a ray of light in 
			an otherwise troubled world.&nbsp; It has been a privilege to be asked to 
			review <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i> as members of the United 
			Kingdom shapenote singing community, a task made easier by the 
			provision of an electronic copy, using LaTeX, a powerful typesetting 
			program, complete with interactive hyperlinks between commentary, 
			indices, and scores.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Music 
			Committee used as their starting point works contained within the 
			five editions of a publication by Ananias Davisson, <i>The Kentucky 
			Harmony</i>, together with three editions <i>of A Supplement to the 
			Kentucky Harmony</i>, published collectively between 1816 and 1825. 
			The intention to produce such an anthology of music expanded to 
			include sacred and secular tunes from a wide range of 18<sup>th </sup>- 
			and 19<sup>th</sup>-century American sources, and to embrace tunes 
			of the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. With the 
			inclusion of pieces in two and three parts as well as standard four 
			part harmony, <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i> offers a wide corpus of 
			music to explore for groups ranging from duos and trios to larger 
			singing schools and shapenote gatherings. &nbsp;&nbsp;The committee�s 
			enlightened decision to resource, or to commission the composition 
			of alto lines for many of the tunes which were originally in three 
			parts only, is applauded.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The use of 
			Lilypond 2.14 as a publishing tool has made lighter work of 
			producing such a large collection of material than other compilers 
			may have experienced in the past.&nbsp; Both the modification of the 
			software to create slightly larger noteheads, and the fonts chosen, 
			allow for greater legibility, clarity and ease of singing than those 
			found in tune books from the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; There 
			are a few instances where dotted slurs over notes in a tune with a 
			peculiar metre might have been more helpful than splitting a 
			syllable.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The ordering of 
			the book, for the most part, follows a traditional historical format 
			starting with exemplars of the earliest, and often simplest, 
			compositional forms.&nbsp;&nbsp; From Bruce Randall's 'Frewsburgh' onwards, 
			compositions from the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> 
			centuries appear at a steady rate, judiciously placed with an eye to 
			key, metre, form � whether strophic or fuguing � and text.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
			little lighter in weight, but of similar dimensions to <i>The Sacred 
			Harp</i>, Ed. 1991, with 480 pages (including indices) <i>The 
			Shenandoah Harmony</i> comprises 469 tunes. Slightly more than half 
			of them are in minor keys, going a long way to redress what has been 
			perceived by some singers as an imbalance of choice between major 
			and minor in other publications. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From a British 
			perspective, it is very rewarding to see the inclusion of several 
			pieces from the west gallery canon, especially those by William 
			Knapp.&nbsp; In the case of his 'Funeral Hymn', however, additional rests 
			appear which are not in the stated source, and disturb the integrity 
			of the text. With William Tans'ur's 'Barby' tune, by 1755 he had 
			extended this plain tune with an attractive fugue, which was 
			reproduced in Boston in Thomas Walter�s <i>The Grounds and Rules of 
			Musick Explained</i>,<i> </i>in 1764. Perhaps an instance of a 
			missed opportunity to include what might have been a superior 
			version of the tune?</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two tunes that 
			have been part of the English carolling tradition in and around the 
			city of Sheffield, documented for more than a century, appear in <i>
			The Shenandoah Harmony</i>. Contrary to the practice of the time, 
			John Wainwright�s 150-year old tune 'Walworth', (known to him as 
			'Christmas Day Hymn'), had the air in the soprano/treble line, and a 
			much beloved variant, 'Old Christians', continues to be sung thus on 
			this side of the Atlantic.&nbsp; To some native ears, the switching of 
			Wainwright's air to the tenor line produces a harmony which sounds 
			at odds to their tradition. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Known also as 
			'Tunbridge', 'Invitation' and principally as 'Knaresborough', Abijah 
			Forbush had included a four part version of James Leach's tune 
			'Jacob�s Well' as 'Stillman' in <i>The Psalmodist�s Assistant</i>, 
			Ed.2, Boston, 1806.&nbsp; <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i> three part 
			version of&nbsp;'Jacob's Well' seems to be missing the emotive strength of 
			'Knaresborough', the four part version predominantly found in 
			English publications and MSS, and together with that which has come 
			down as part of the Sheffield carolling tradition. &nbsp;Much more could 
			be said about the history of these tunes and their transmission to 
			America, would space permit.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The committee are 
			congratulated on giving Daniel Read's 'Stafford' a less pejorative 
			text than that used almost exclusively since its first publication 
			in 1782, together with the restoration of the fugue in his tune 
			'Lisbon'; &nbsp;it is a delight to find it whole again in <i>The 
			Shenandoah Harmony</i> following its 'fugectomy' in <i>The Sacred 
			Harp</i>.&nbsp; The reviewers look forward to this practice being 
			extended to other similarly treated tunes. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was pleasing to see 
			the inclusion of Ezra Goff's 'Sutton New' and the Babcock tune 
			'Springfield', personal favourites of several years, together with 
			Elias Mann�s tune 'Foster'.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also welcomed are 
			arrangements of tunes from the tradition of the Lee family of 
			Hoboken and from the Sand Mountain tradition; John Bayer�s 
			arrangement of the latter's 'Symyadda' is another gem in the 
			collection. &nbsp;The Glen Rock Carollers have their origins in an 
			English oral tradition of carol singing which has been perpetuated 
			in southern Pennsylvania for more than 150 years.&nbsp; Having heard them 
			at the Festival of Village Carols in both 2002 and 2012, it was 
			exciting to find the committee had selected their 'Hark, Hark' � a 
			version of the tune 'Sheffield Park' by John Hall, now known as 'New 
			Hark'.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given that the 
			original project had as its crux the tunes from Ananias Davisson's 
			publications in the second and third decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
			century, the decision to include more than sixty 20<sup>th</sup>- 
			and 21<sup>st</sup>-century compositions in <i>The Shenandoah 
			Harmony</i> was a bold one, but a wise one. &nbsp;It would be invidious 
			to single out particular tunes and their composers for praise, but 
			if there was one modern song which might tip the balance as to 
			whether to purchase a copy of <i>The Shenandoah Harmony </i>or not, 
			Richard Popp's 'Stony Island' is a strong candidate.&nbsp; A minor fuguing tune in the best tradition, with a text presaging changes in 
			theology, and a memorable alto line; the only complaint would be the 
			absence of additional verses, James Montgomery�s fourth verse would 
			certainly serve.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another inspired 
			move by the committee was to draw on D.H. Mansfield�s seminal 
			publication, <i>The American Vocalist, </i>1848. This edition was a 
			source first encountered by the reviewers through Larry Gordon, 
			Anthony Barrand and Carole Moody Crompton�s <i>Northern Harmony</i>, 
			rev. 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., 1995. It is a joy to be given the 
			opportunity to revisit these versions of 'All Is Well' and 'Amazing 
			Grace', in particular.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This leads to 
			consideration as to how the content of <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i> 
			mirrors the expansion of interest in the shapenote genre over the 
			past 30 years or so.&nbsp; 1991 saw the publication of the latest edition 
			of <i>The Sacred Harp</i>, offering new compositions together with 
			exploring previously untapped sources of psalmody that predated the 
			compilation of Smith and Little's <i>Easy Instructor</i>, 1801.&nbsp; 
			Eleven years previously, in Vermont, Larry Gordon <i>et al</i> had 
			collaborated to self-publish <i>Northern Harmony</i>, containing for 
			the most part compositions from the First New England School.&nbsp; The 
			second edition in 1990 expanded to include new works, and in 1993 
			the third edition continued this process, adding music from what had 
			become to be recognised as the west gallery tradition in the United 
			Kingdom.&nbsp; The fifth edition, published in 2012, offers the same 
			eclectic mix as in previous years, but celebrates the growth of 
			modern compositions in the genre on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp; The 
			selection of tunes over the years by Gordon <i>et al</i> have become 
			widely known and loved by singers in the United Kingdom, and the 
			inclusion in <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i> of 28 of those previously 
			published in <i>Northern Harmony</i> 1993 bears testament to the 
			Vermonters' innate sense of a good tune.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In similar vein, 
			the scholarly <i>Norumbega Harmony</i>, 2003, offers historic tunes 
			from the First New England School and modern works, together with 
			pieces from the Western and Southern States, indicative of the 
			emergence of interest in folk tunes, exemplified, <i>inter alia</i>, 
			by those that appear in the Kentucky Harmony. There, 38 of the 
			choices of the editorial committee in Boston chime with those of <i>
			The Shenandoah Harmony</i>, and several pieces appear in all three 
			collections.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is possible 
			the resonances between the three books will appeal initially to 
			those singers in the UK who were first made aware of shapenote music 
			by Larry Gordon, but there is so much more to <i>The Shenandoah 
			Harmony</i> than just a happy coincidence of some old favourites in 
			a new publication.&nbsp; What started out as an intention to bring the 
			music and the times of the <i>Kentucky Harmony</i> to a 21<sup>st</sup> 
			-century audience, has patently expanded to embrace the demands of a 
			new generation of singers and composers who have been eager for the 
			opportunity to be more involved with this exciting genre.&nbsp; Were 
			there any doubt about this, the YouTube videos and recordings of 
			enthusiastic renderings of <i>The Shenandoah Harmony</i> sampler 
			collection from early 2012 onwards, are more than sufficient 
			testament. Thanks are due to the groups of singers on both sides of 
			the Atlantic who, over the past year, have welcomed these tunes into 
			their shapenote repertoire. The leap of faith shown by <i>The 
			Shenandoah Harmony </i>Music Committee in their decision to 
			self-publish a new anthology for a new millennium is well 
			justified.&nbsp; The times certainly are a-changing, order your copy now.</font></p>
