					Soul: The Story of the Sacred Harp&quot;</a> by Matt and Erica 
					Hinton, Standard One-Disc and Special Two-Disc Editions
					</strong>
					<p>The Hintons, filmakers and Sacred Harp singers from 
					Atlanta, Georgia, produced a feature-length documentary film 
					and DVD, released in 2006, on the history, music, and 
					traditions of Sacred Harp singing. As described in detail on 
					the movie's outstanding <a href="http://www.awakemysoul.com">
					Web site</a>, over the course of seven years, the Hintons 
					painstakingly amassed hundreds of hours of digital video 
					footage at traditional Sacred Harp singings (from the 
					Denson/1991 book) in Georgia and Alabama and interviewed the 
					most prominent traditional Sacred Harp singers and 
					composers.</p>
					<p>&quot;Awake, My Soul&quot; includes historical material illustrated 
					by rare archival images, interviews with singers who share 
					their often moving personal histories, and the music itself. 
					Long-time Sacred Harp singer and historian Buell Cobb 
					states: &quot;I found it mesmerizing to see, in the context of a 
					film interview, people I've known for years -- and hear them 
					tell things about their background, their introduction to 
					Sacred Harp, etc., that I had never known. The deft weaving 
					together of so many strands of story, of testimony, of old 
					photographs, of roving camera, of stirring music, makes for 
					a very compelling hour and a quarter.&quot; </p>
					<p>The film is narrated by Jim Lauderdale, edited by 
					Jennifer Brooks, researched and co-written by John Plunkett, 
					and produced by Mac Powell and Tai Anderson. Subtitles 
					accompany most of the interviews to enhance comprehension. 
					The film has been shown at singing conventions and on many 
					public television stations around the nation with very 
					positive feedback. In 2007 the Hintons released a <strong>
					two-DVD Special Edition</strong> which contains the original 
					documentary (found on disc 1 but not listed in the Contents 
					printed on the box), plus deleted scenes, additional 
					interview footages from Sacred Harp singers commenting on a 
					variety of subjects (e.g. memories, community, the music, 
					history, faith, etc.), over two hours of Sacred Harp singing 
					(62 songs) from 1998-2006, and other features. </p>
					<p>Sacred Harp singers will be amply rewarded for ordering 
					the Special rather than the Standard Edition. The Standard 
					Edition (SHR-DVD001 and Special Edition (SHR-DVD002) are 
					available for $20.00 and $27.00, respectively, plus shipping 
					when ordered online at the
					<a href="http://www.awakemysoul.com">Web site</a>. 
					Educational purchases and licenses are also available. The 
					Web site also has interesting material and photographs 
					concerning Sacred Harp singing, as well as a streaming-audio 
					trailer of as-good-as-it-gets Sacred Harp singing. </td>

					<h2><font color="#47635E">About the Movie:</font></h2>
					<p>
					<img border="0" src="../../images/awake/clips27.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="131">&quot;Awake, 
					My Soul&quot; is a feature documentary that explores the history, 
					music, and traditions of Sacred Harp singing, the oldest 
					surviving American music. While often linked only to its 
					history, (e.g. the songs were used in the recent historical 
					films &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; and &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;) this haunting 
					music has survived over 200 years tucked away from sight in 
					the rural deep south, where in old wooden country churches, 
					devoted singers break open The Sacred Harp, a shape note 
					hymnal first published in Georgia in 1844. These singers 
					have inherited The Sacred Harp and its traditions from those 
					who came before them and preserved these fierce yet 
					beautiful songs, many of which are much older than the 
					hymnal itself. And so they, like the early singers, begin 
					each song by intoning syllables which are represented by 
					each shaped note in their hymnal: fa, sol, la, and mi. To 
					the casual observer, it is some foreign, unintelligible 
					language, but to these Sacred Harp singers, it is the key 
					that unlocks mysteries: songs of both beauty and sorrow, of 
					life and of death, songs that cause feet to stomp and tears 
					to flow, often at the same time. They are ancient sounds, 
					which are at times disorienting to the modern ear, and yet 
					they are sung with such passion and force that it becomes 
					obvious that these songs are very much alive. Awake My Soul 
					is a film that captures both the history and the vitality of 
					a music that is utterly unlike any music most viewers are 
					likely to have heard.</p>
					<p>Insofar as Sacred Harp is among the earliest music in 
					America, its history is incredibly rich. The narrative that 
					emerges in this history is full of inspiring stories and of 
					conflict, mostly with the cultural elites. In this way, the 
					Sacred Harp tradition can be seen as being, on one hand 
					conservative, in that it has preserved these old songs, and 
					on the other hand, subversive, in that it has consistently 
					repelled any attempts to tame or change it by the cultural 
					and musical elites.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../../images/awake/clips28.jpg" align="left" width="140" height="93"><br>
					What is most moving about &quot;Awake, My Soul&quot;, however, is the 
					singers themselves who wear their hearts on their sleeves 
					when it comes to the songs they sing. These singers are 
					surprisingly articulate, deeply thoughtful and often very 
					funny individuals who are passionate about Sacred Harp 
					singing. As Richard Delong puts it in the film, &quot;We 
					scheduled life around Sacred Harp singing. We didn't 
					schedule Sacred Harp singing around life.&quot;</p>
					<p>
					<img border="0" src="../../images/awake/clips29.jpg" align="right" width="140" height="93"><br>
					Over the course of 7 years, two Atlanta filmmakers, Erica 
					and Matt Hinton, have painstakingly amassed hundreds of 
					hours of traditional Sacred Harp singings in the southeast 
					as well as interviews with the most prominent traditional 
					Sacred Harp singers and composers.</p>
					<p>
					<img border="0" src="../../images/awake/clips210.jpg" align="left" width="140" height="93"> 
					&quot;Awake, My Soul&quot; is a wonderfully detailed quilt made up of 
					historical material illustrated by rare archival images, 
					interviews with singers who share their often moving 
					personal histories, and the music itself, which is both 
					earthy and otherworldly at the same time. It once was lost 
					but now it's found: This is the story of the Sacred Harp.</p>
					<h3>Producer/ Director's Statement</h3>
					<p>I discovered Sacred Harp singing in 1991. At a concert in 
					Atlanta, I heard about an upcoming &quot;shaped note&quot; singing 
					that was being held about in North Georgia. As I approached 
					the Primitive Baptist Church where the singing was held, I 
					could already hear voices. It was the sound, not of a choir, 
					but of people singing. People with flaws and without perfect 
					pitch, but meaning every word of it: &quot;Serve with a single 
					heart and eye, and to Thy glory live or die.&quot; I immediately 
					felt transported. What can I call this experience? 
					Overwhelmed. There is a sense in which this moment informed 
					the entire making of &quot;&quot;Awake, My Soul&quot;&quot;. It became my desire 
					for others to experience this moment as well.&nbsp; Ever 
					since, I have tried to convince my friends that if they will 
					only drive 45
					<img border="0" src="../../images/awake/clips211.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="249">minutes, 
					their minds will be blown. Yet, 45 minutes is a tall order 
					evidently. I decided if they will not come to a singing, I 
					must bring the singing to them. And so, if no one else was 
					willing to step up and make a movie so I can blow my 
					friends' minds, I suppose we must do it. There are some who 
					claim that in documentary filmmaking, the filmmaker must be 
					an objective observer. If this is so, we are not documentary 
					filmmakers. My desire is to manipulate the emotions of the 
					viewer. I like to be manipulated. It's fun. (or, perhaps, 
					interesting) It is not exploitation: It is simply the 
					enjoyment of watching others, dumbfounded by this haunting 
					music, by those men in tears, by that boy studying the old 
					woman's hand. Film is, after all, a medium of communication. 
					The goal of our film is to communicate ideas, on one hand. 
					But on the other hand, we wanted to communicate a feeling.</p>
					<p>As it happens, the ideas we wanted to communicate were 
					fascinating. The history and details of this rich tradition 
					could easily fill a 5 part series. After all, it is the 
					earliest American musical tradition extant. We had hundreds 
					of years of this story to draw from and as much as 200 hours 
					of footage. The embarrassment of riches that is inherent in 
					this musical tradition is not without problems, however. We 
					wanted to make the most accessible film possible, which 
					meant making difficult choices in order to keep it under 2 
					hours. Do we explore the various competing editions of the 
					book? Do we tell the story of the black Sacred Harp singers 
					of Alabama, or the northern singers who have picked up the 
					book? But these are subjects that deserve their own films, 
					rather than occupying a mere chapter in this one. We had to 
					kill our darlings, as they say.</p>
					<p>In order to communicate the feeling, we simply had to 
					present the music and the singers as truthfully as we could- 
					without fast edits or a stylized look. And yet, it certainly 
					has a timeless feel: Well worn, like the music and singers.
